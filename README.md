# Catch-The-Light

Made as part of Arcade Hack Club

Used github copilot when writing code and readme.

Inspired by the arcade game [Speed Demon](https://www.arcade-museum.com/Arcade/speed-demon) I wanted to make crude version of it using a circular LED matrix I found ounline.

## Hardware

I made a base out of 8mm MDF and used a 3D printed spacer to hold the LED rings.
This was not a very good design as MDF had a tendency to split and it my paint job was not the best.

The stop button is a random button I found in my parts bin.
I also made two custom backlit signs for the game: green "YOU WIN" and red "TRY AGAIN".

The signs were printed in multiple parts and glued together (there is no need for a multi material printer).

There is also a small buzzer for sound effects.

The whole build is powered by a 5V 3A meanwell power supply with a switch mounted in the front and a C13 power socket in the back.

The brains of the operation is an arduino nano clone on piece of perfboard.
